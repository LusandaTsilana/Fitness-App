# Project: FITNESS TRACKER 

I'm currently developing a fitness app using React Native with Expo called the GetUp App. Tailored for fitness enthusiasts, it serves as a mobile application enabling users to plan and track their workouts effortlessly. The app will provide a platform to create personalized workout routines, access to an exercise library, and connect with a community for support and advice.
